## 2.0.8
2048 Heroes can quickly achieve 2048 blocks, or use high attack power to process waves to blow up the opponent's base.
You can win.

However, in the current block growth method, the process of increasing the number to achieve 2048 is the direction to increase the attack power.
It was difficult to break the strategy to achieve the 2048 block by using an aggressive deck, etc.

To improve this problem, the amount of increase in attack power when combining blocks has been modified as follows.
Through this, the closer to the achievement of the 2048 block, the higher the risk by lowering the overall attack power.
You can check the related details in the tutorial in Settings.

1. Block's attack power growth
- Previously: Increases attack power by 50% when combining blocks
