## 2.0.8
2048 Heroes can quickly achieve 2048 blocks, or use high attack power to process waves to blow up the opponent's base.
You can win.

However, in the current block growth method, the process of increasing the number to achieve 2048 is the direction to increase the attack power.
It was difficult to break the strategy to achieve the 2048 block by using an aggressive deck, etc.

To improve this problem, the amount of increase in attack power when combining blocks has been modified as follows.
Through this, the closer to the achievement of the 2048 block, the higher the risk by lowering the overall attack power.
You can check the related details in the tutorial in Settings.

1. Block's attack power growth
- Previously: Increases attack power by 50% when combining blocks

## 1.2.2
Based on tower defense, 2048 heroes is a strategic tower defense game where you overcome the opponent with your own strategy while solving puzzles with the skills of various heroes.

Use a hero with good attack power, such as a swordsman or a mob, to quickly organize the wave to press the opponent,
Achieve 2048 quickly through skills that increase the number of blocks such as pioneers and speakers
It was designed so that you can play various strategies by taking advantage of the personalities of the heroes.

However, due to the current wave design, the monster's HP is low.
